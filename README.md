# Nju

Lah-dee-dah, I'm lazy, sue me.

So, basically, the play is, that I'm too lazy to do this:

```
mygit // alias I have for my git repos
cd youshy.github.io/posts
vim 2019-09-25-posttopic.md
```

But I want to do this from anywhere I am:

```
nju post <Title>
```

Well, because I can. And I'm able and willing to do 150% work to do 2% then. And also - this is my, like, 4th blog ever? I want to use this as a stream of thoughts rather than "THIS HAS TO BE PERFECT ALL THE TIME".

## How do I use it?

Create an alias for the binary in this repo. It'll pick up the flag and then the title and create the files automatically.

### Ideas for the future

* [ ] Automatic commit after I'd finish the post

* [ ] Open up VIM, write post, publish it

* [ ] Add flag for setting up future posts
